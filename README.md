# Frame Blocker Filter
## Introduction to Frame Blocker Filter
You can block third party frames and all frames. It can block Iframes and anything similar, like scripts or any other methods for embed. It can block all the things referred to "subdocuments" or frames. Never use two or more variations of this filter at a time, that may cause a conflict and may not unblock/block whatever you want to.
<br>
<br>
Designed for: AdBlock Plus and compatible adblockers (like UBlock Origin, AdBlock and etc.)
<br>
## 3rd Party only Frame Blocking (Blocks 3rd Party Sites' Frames)
This is the one I can recommend to everyone wanting a good privacy, as it blocks everything that is 3rd party only with zero exceptions.

## 3rd Party only Frame Blocking with Google and YouTube exceptions (Blocks 3rd Party Sites' Frames except Google and YouTube)
If you are a privacy guy but still a fan of Google and YouTube, well consider using this one instead.

<br>
## 3rd Party only Frame Blocking with Social Media exceptions (Blocks 3rd Party Sites' Frames except common Social Media sites and Google)
If you are really a fan of the common social media sites but wants to maintain privacy on other non-google or non-social media sites, well use this one.

## All Frames Blocking (Blocks all Frames)
This filter is so strong that it gives more than privacy. More than Privacy means that even non-tracking or non-3rd party frames will be blocked.
<br>
Please just note that even "basic" functions of a website may disappear.
